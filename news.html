          <div class="para">On Friday, May 12, 2017, Franklin Township Youth Council invited Project Break The Cycle to attend their annual "Stuffed with Love" event. Over 30 young adults came together and designed shirts for several types of teddy bears. After the designing process was over, each shirt was put onto a stuffed bear of their choice. After the event, all of the customized teddy bears were donated to the children of the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare!
          </div>
          <div class="para">Thank you to the members of the Franklin Township Youth Council for organizing this event, and we will be looking forward to working with them in the future!

          <div class="para">On December 26, 2016, www.projectbreakthecycle.com was launched for the first time. Over the past three months, over 2,000 people have accessed our website to learn more about the cycle of childhood poverty, help support us, or even both. It is a privilege to have the support of over 2,000 individuals within the first three months of our existence.

          <div class="para">On February 5, 2017, we launched the first part of our charity clothing line in which 100% of the profits went directly to HTSW. Part 1 included a hooded sweatshirt with a unique cherry blossom embroidery. The sweatshirt was crafted from premium cotton and soft inner linings. In addition, the cherry blossom embroidery on the upper chest held great significance, as seen from the description on the product page.
          </div>
          <div class="para">Not only did we launch a clothing line, but we also worked with businesses to establish relationships that would help us along our mission. Since we officially launched only three months ago, PBTC still has work to do. However, we were able to work with Amazon.com, LLC and integrate our organization into their Amazon Smile program. If you shop on Amazon.com, be sure to take a look at our Corporate Relations page and sign up for free! A portion of your purchases can go directly to Project Break The Cycle at no extra cost every time you purchase something! Setup takes only 1-2 minutes.

          <div class="para">Together, as of March 29, 2017, we have raised $2,128.81 for the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare. These funds will directly go towards providing resources for the children of HTSW, including private education, books, school supplies, and more. Without your help, we could not have sparked the beginning of change for these children. Without your help, we could not have reached over 2,000 individuals in 40 different countries. Without your help, Project Break The Cycle would not be where it currently is.
