          <div class="para">The Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare was founded in 1975, drawing its name from its location in the second largest city in Lebanon. A group of concerned locals, led by Mr. Mostafa Ziadeh and Ms. Suha Ziadeh, worked to establish the organization in its early years. After Mr. Mostafa Ziadeh passed away in 1991, Ms. Suha Ziadeh, his wife, took on his responsibilities at the orphanage. While growing up, Ms. Ziadeh observed what her local orphanage was doing to its children and thought about what could be changed to create a more positive environment. She recalled that the center looked like a prison: children were constantly trying to makes holes in the walls to escape because of the orphanage’s policy for keeping all the doors locked. Ms. Z concluded that nobody was raising and educating the children correctly. In adulthood, she realized that she needed to act upon her childhood instincts and help work to fix the situation. The War of Lebanon was a particularly powerful motivator. This civil war accounted for an increase in fatherless children, poverty, and rates of illiteracy among women. In addition, this war decreased the amount of resources available for people to use inside the country. There were fewer jobs, and the youth had much less infrastructure than their parents’ generation.

          <div class="para">In 1975, the Lebanese government donated less than $1/day per child to cover their expenses. Today, the government donates approximately $4/day per child to cover expenses. This is obviously not enough to cover basic costs, including electricity, water, food, etc. Although electricity may seem to be cheap in the USA, Lebanon does not have electric power 24/7. When there is no power throughout the city, the center must use its own diesel-powered generator to produce electricity. Alongside other factors, this increases daily costs drastically. Over the course of the center’s existence, Ms. Ziadeh has taken in both orphans and needy children off of the streets and into a safe and loving environment. Unfortunately, the center is an all-boy orphanage because she does not have the resources to support both boys and girls. However, in the future, she hopes that she will open another center that provides the same opportunities and resources for girls.

          <div class="para">HTSW is committed to changing children’s lives. Its goal is to make sure that children can apply what they have learned to their daily lives. This includes academic knowledge, as well as etiquette. At the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare, workers and volunteers treat each child like their own, providing them with a source of love and comfort. As opposed to their lives before joining the organization, each child gets served three fresh meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. To establish etiquette, all of the children eat with each other at the same time. This equates to a sense of family and unity, which, unfortunately, is lacking within their communities. Organization is a key pillar of HTSW. For example, each child has his own medical file that is kept private and neat. Checkups and doctor visits are routinely scheduled. However, all of these intensive services require monetary support beyond what the government of Lebanon provides.

          <div class="para">There are many reasons to why these children and their families are in the cycle of poverty. For example, their father might be incarcerated. Even if the charge against him is minor, the father generally serves a long sentence because he cannot afford a good lawyer. Also, drug and alcohol addictions are a major concern. Addicted parents spend all the family’s money on drugs to feed their addictions while putting the family in danger. Another significant area of need is medical care. Sometimes, minor diseases can become fatal as people cannot afford the correct medicine or appointments with a doctor. A death in the family means that they are left grieving, and in further economic distress if the deceased was employed.

          <div class="para">Further familial troubles include spousal tensions. In many instances, the mother is employed and earns a salary. However, sometimes the father does not have a job and becomes jealous that the woman in the family is the primary provider. He then abuses her for money, and then goes and spends it on harmful substances like alcohol and drugs. After the mother gets a divorce, the child is stuck in between the two parents. He/she does not get the childhood they deserve in order to be successful and change their lives.

          <div class="para">Unfortunately, in a large city the size of Tripoli, there are often no real job opportunities that can support a poor family. With little to no income being generated within these families, homelessness, starvation, illness, and worse too often become facets of everyday life. Also, poor families in Tripoli exhibit trends in diabetes and kidney problems, most likely due to malnutrition. Accessibility to healthy foods is directly dependent on family incomes. Therefore, if a family is financially unstable, it is likely that they will be consuming more unhealthy foods as opposed to nutritional ones.

          <div class="para">The gap between public education systems in developed nations and developing nations is still an issue. Lebanon's public school system has not changed for many years (specifically from 1943 to present). Although many educators are extremely knowledgeable, they do not have the qualifications or the experience required in order to teach. This leads to teachers going into the education system with ample knowledge on a variety of subjects, but lacking critical experience on how to convey this information. In the past, Lebanon had teacher training centers where individuals aspiring to teach were given the appropriate training; however, as a result of government budget cuts, these centers were forced to close down in 2005. As a result, Lebanese students are only able to get a sufficient education by attending private schools, a heavy financial burden on their families.

          <div class="para">Ms. Ziadeh, the director of the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare, has made large strides in order to compensate for this lack of education. Every one of her children is enrolled in a private school. There, they have more of an opportunity to learn and benefit as opposed to public schools. Not only does Ms. Ziadeh have each student enrolled in private school, she also hires tutors who come in daily after school. Instead of just letting the tutors work with no structure, Ms. Z prefers to train them prior to student contact. Every so often, she holds meetings with these instructors, and discusses the areas of improvement needed in their teaching styles. Untrained tutors would be useless for the kids, so educating the instructors on how to convey information and properly approach students is crucial. Getting additional help when the tutors return solidifies the students' grasp of the concept, which ultimately strengthens their knowledge.

          <div class="para">Despite the problematic public education system currently present in Lebanon, HTSW finds a way to provide its children with proper education, a staple in PBTC's mission to eradicate the cycle of poverty.

          <div class="para">We take your money seriously. Donations and 100% of profits from merchandise go towards the many different aspects of the center, from school education to recreation. HTSW has to cover the costs of schooling for all of its children. Also, books are another major cost for the organization. They need students to be able to study from them and use them in school. Some tutors are volunteers, but most of them are trained professionals who need to be paid. Ms. Ziadeh and her tutors routinely meet with each other to have training sessions and talk about the strengths and weaknesses of their current style of teaching. Cleaning supplies, beds, food, water, and electricity also contribute to the high costs of running this facility. Lebanon does not have electricity 24/7, so HTSW has to purchase diesel fuel to run its generators to produce electricity. Maintenance and remodeling are very important to the organization. If the facilities look torn up and dirty, it can have psychological effects on the children.

          <div class="para">Remodeling is needed in order to improve the living conditions and the atmosphere of the center. For example, a new playground would be a lovely addition to the center’s damaged one. New swings, slides, carousels, and more could allow the children to have more fun when playing outside. There would be much less worries about injuries related to broken and missing parts of playground structures. In addition, with some minor financial help, the center could buy materials to start art projects on the available bare walls. Here, the kids can use their imagination and creativity to paint whatever they want, or even work together to make one giant art project! The possibilities are limitless!

          <div class="para">As stated before, a large amount of the center's costs goes towards basic necessities, like food, water, and electricity. However, there are many things that can be improved upon in the center. For example, the computer room has extremely outdated computer systems. New computers and and instruction on how to use them could certainly help the students. The world is becoming extremely technology-dependent, and being competent in computer usage can play a role in their educations. Renovations for the building's outside appearance, gardens, and walls can create an uplifting effect for the children and volunteers.
